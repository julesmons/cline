**Context**
This is the codebase of the Recline VSCode extension itself.
Recline is an autonomous AI assistant that seamlessly integrates with your CLI and editor to create, edit, and run; redefining how you code.

**Facts**
- The project uses rsbuild to build (Note: NOT a typo and NOT esbuild)
- The project uses pnpm for dependency management

**Rules**
1. *IGNORE ALL ESLINT ERRORS*
2. *DO NOT* write any tests unless *EXPLICITLY* asked to do so
